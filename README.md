# Next.js Backend API Documentation

## Introduction

**Welcome to the documentation for our Next.js Backend API**. This guide details the creation and implementation of an API route handler within a Next.js environment, focusing on versions 13 and 14.

Our primary goal is to interface with advanced AI models, specifically `OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-4-pythia-12b-epoch-3.5`, to facilitate real-time, streamed responses to user interactions. This backend is designed to process user conversations seamlessly, leveraging the AI model to generate dynamic responses, which are streamed directly to ensure a responsive user experience.

The system is optimized for efficient integration with frontend applications, providing a robust, real-time conversational interface.

## Workflow

### 1. Utilizing APP Router in Next.js 13/14

Next.js versions 13 and 14 introduce an interaction model with the APP router, distinct from the traditional page router used in Next.js 12. This new model significantly simplifies the creation of route handlers directly within the `APP` directory.

### 2. Creating Route Handlers

- **API Directory Structure:**

  - Within the `src` directory of your Next.js application, navigate to the `APP` directory.
  - Here, create a dedicated `API` directory. This will be the container for your API route handlers.

- **Defining Route Handlers:**

  - Inside the `API` directory, create a file named `route.ts` (or `route.js` if you're using JavaScript).
  - This filename is recognized by Next.js as a route handler. It's essential to use this specific naming convention for Next.js to correctly identify and handle the route.
  - For detailed information on route handler naming and structure, refer to the official Next.js documentation on [Routing & Colocation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#colocation).

- **Accessing the API Endpoint:**
  - The structure of your folders and files within the `API` directory directly corresponds to the URL path of your API endpoint.
  - For example, if you place your `route.ts` file within a folder path like `api/response`, your API endpoint will be accessible at the same path (e.g., `/api/response`).
