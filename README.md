Next.js Backend API Documentation
Introduction
Welcome to the documentation for our Next.js (version 13/14) Backend API. This guide details the creation and implementation of an API route handler within a Next.js environment. Our primary focus is on interfacing with advanced AI models, specifically OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-4-pythia-12b-epoch-3.5, to facilitate real-time, streamed responses to user interactions.

This backend is designed to seamlessly process user conversations, leveraging the AI model to generate dynamic responses. These responses are streamed directly, ensuring a fluid and responsive user experience. This system is optimized to integrate efficiently with frontend applications, providing a robust, real-time conversational interface.
