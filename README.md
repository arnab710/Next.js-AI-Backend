# Next.js Backend API Documentation

## Introduction

**Welcome to the documentation for our Next.js Backend API**. This guide details the creation and implementation of an API route handler within a Next.js environment, focusing on versions 13 and 14.

Our primary goal is to interface with advanced AI models, specifically `OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-4-pythia-12b-epoch-3.5`, to facilitate real-time, streamed responses to user interactions. This backend is designed to process user conversations seamlessly, leveraging the AI model to generate dynamic responses, which are streamed directly to ensure a fluid and responsive user experience.

The system is optimized for efficient integration with frontend applications, providing a robust, real-time conversational interface.
